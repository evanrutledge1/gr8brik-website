&lt;BUG FIXES&gt;

GR8BRIK 6-20-24 fixed Chrome 46-61 not launching GR8BRIK because it had a syntax error- ignored by Firefox and newer Chrome versions (Chrome 100-126). Also it is faster on older hardware when switching modes (Eg paint mode to build mode) as well as changing &quot;utils&quot; to &quot;settings&quot;.</td></table><br /><hr />
